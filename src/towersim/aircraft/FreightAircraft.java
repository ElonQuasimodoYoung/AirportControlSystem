     * the total amount of freight to be loaded based on the {@code LOAD} task's load percentage,
     * divided by the loading time given by {@link #getLoadingTime()}. This ensures that freight
     * is loaded in equal increments across the entire loading time. The result of this division

     * maximum freight capacity of the aircraft, given by

     * of type {@code LOAD} with a load percentage of 65%. The aircraft has a freight capacity of
     * 40,000kg. Then, the total amount of freight to be loaded is 65% of 40,000kg = 26,000kg.
     * According to {@link #getLoadingTime()}, this amount of freight will take 2 ticks to load.
     * So, a single call to {@code tick()} should increase the amount of freight onboard by
     * 26,000kg / 2 = 13,000kg.
